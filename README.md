# piki

> A simple Spritz-like reader.

* * *

## What's this ?

**piki** is a simple fast-reader, trying to mimic the [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com) technology.

I was very impressed by the demo of Spritz, but can't test it in french, my main language.  
So, while waiting for an open Spritz API, I've done this.

## Usage

Take a look at the `example` folder !

**piki** is more a *proof-of-concept* than a viable concept, but it  has been written as a jQuery plugin.

There's no documentation at the moment, but you can read the code !

Feel free to fork it for your own usage !
